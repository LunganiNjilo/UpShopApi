# UpShop API

This is the backend API for the **UpShop** application. It provides product data and supports endpoints used by the frontend.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the API locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LunganiNjilo/UpShopApi.git
cd UpShopApi
```
### 2. Set Up the API in Docker

Build and start the API using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up
```
After this, the API will be running at: http://localhost:5000

### 3. Test API Endpoints

Check that the API is working by visiting these endpoints in a browser or using Postman:

- Get all products:
```bash
http://localhost:5000/api/products
```
- Get a single product by SKU:
  
```bash
http://localhost:5000/api/products/SKU-0001
```

### ðŸ§ª Running Tests
#### Unit/Integration Tests
The test project is located at:
```text
..\UpShopApi\UpShopTests
```
To run the tests from the terminal:

```bash
cd ..\UpShopApi\UpShopTests
dotnet test
```
#### Benchmark Tests
Run the benchmark test project with:
```bash
cd ..\UpShopApi\UpShopApi.Benchmarks
dotnet test
```
##### Thresholds
Each benchmark test validates performance against thresholds (in milliseconds).
```csharp
public static class PerformanceThresholds
{
    public const int GetAllProductsThresholdMs = 150;       // â‰¤ 150 ms
    public const int GetProductBySkuThresholdMs = 50;       // â‰¤ 50 ms
    public const int ConcurrentRequestThresholdMs = 200;    // â‰¤ 200 ms
}
```
- Development: You may relax thresholds (e.g. +50ms) since local builds arenâ€™t optimized.
- Testing: Use thresholds close to production to catch regressions.
- Production: Keep strict thresholds (â‰¤ 150ms for list endpoints, â‰¤ 50ms for single-item endpoints).

To adjust thresholds, simply modify the values above and re-run tests.

#### Functional Tests
In this project, the functional tests were created to validate the behavior of the API endpoints, especially focusing on Products and ensuring that the clean architecture (Controller â†’ Services â†’ Infrastructure) works end-to-end.

The test project is located at:
```text
..\UpShopApi\UpShopApi.FunctionalTests
```
To run the tests from the terminal:

```bash
cd ..\UpShopApi\UpShopApi.FunctionalTests
dotnet test
```

### 4.Database Information

The API uses SQLite, so no additional database setup is required. The database file is included in the project:

```bash
..\UpShopApi\UpShopApi\Infrastructure\Sql
```

### 5. Example API Response
Hereâ€™s an example response for the endpoint /api/products/SKU-0001:

```json
{
  "id": "b1a7d2f0-0001-4b10-9aee-123456789001",
  "sku": "SKU-0001",
  "name": "Classic White T-Shirt",
  "price": 199.99,
  "availableQuantity": 50,
  "imageUrl": "/images/products/SKU-0001.webp",
  "featured": true,
  "onSpecial": false
}
```

### 6.Notes
- Ensure Docker is installed and running before starting the API.
- Architecture is Clean: Controller â†’ Services â†’ Infrastructure, keeping business logic separate from infrastructure and endpoints.
